The course Computer Simulation @ Sharif University of Technology ---Fall2018-2019


HW1: A simple question regarding the Queueing theory. The impact of different probabilistic parameters on the entire performance of a system was examined.

HW2: Implementing Random number generators using different algorithms. NSPP, LCG, CLCG, and CDF_Inverse of exponential & triangular distributions were implemented. 

HW3: Using SIMEVENT in Matlab, different queueing algorithms, like FIFO, were implemented and tested via producing random numbers from desired distributions.
